JavaScript is responsible for the interactive layer of web page.
programming language used runs in browser and allows website to respond to user actions

Java and JavaScript not at all related with each other have similar syntax 1995 Netscape   originally named LiveScript
Standardized ECMAScript too ensure it works same across all browser.

Two latest versions EC5 2009 and EC6 2015
 major updates 
ECMAScript is latest version that JavaScript follows

Written in two ways internal and external 
we use script tag while writing internal js
whereas use link to connect the other external js file to run js in site
js is case sensitive and white space insensitive.
scopes defines the visibility and lifespan of a element.

every curly braces is forming a block and block is just a small area 

four types of scope:
1. Global scope : variables declared outside of fn/block have global scope;
2. Function scope : variable declared inside fn are limited to global scope; cannot be accessed outside fn even if fn is global.
3. Block scope : refers to code segment bw curly braces for example loops, conditionals and fns	
4. Module scope : variables declared inside JS modules declared inside Module scope , need to explicitly export and import variables and functions to use them in other files. 


Polyfill: is piece of code that adds new JS funtion to old browsers might not have.Ex core js
Transfill: converts modern js code into older versions that browsers understand.Ex Babel is popular tranfiler

LOOPS:
for(intialization;condition;increment/decrement) 
while(condition) 
do() while(condition)
for in: for (key in object)
for of: for (value of iterable)

Funtion :
Reusable block of code to perform actions reducingg repetition and keepint the code organized .
you can thank of them as named blocks of code that can be called multiple times.

switch (value){
    case value1:
    ??code
    break;
    case value2:.....
    break;
    default:
    //default block:
}


unary operator: converts string or non number to number.
+a:a
+'3'->3


nullish coelesing assignment a??=b: a=a??b It assigns a value to a variable is null or undefined
