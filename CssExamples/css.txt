content: inner part of box where image and text appear ; can be defined using height and width
padding: space bw content and border 
border: a line wraps around the padding  can be  controlled using border ,
border defines boundry of the element we define it by size then style then color
write 5 examples:

margin outer most layer that creates space b/w elements border and surrounding elements

selectors:
patters used to select and style elements in an HTML doc


1. Type/element select:
p{
} gives style to all p elements 


2. Container Selector

3. Class Selector: selects all elements with specific class  ex : class="container" 
.container{
}

4. Descendent Selector

5.ID selector

6.Universal Selector

7.Group selector

8. input attribute selector

9. pseudo classes:
is used to define special state of an element for example you can apply styles when a user hovers over  link or when form element is focused

Common pseudo class examples
:hover ->user hovers on element
:focused-> element is focused
:visited->links have been visited
:active->element is currently being activated such as link being clicked
:nth-child(): applies style to element based on postition in a group

pseudo- element: allows you to style specific parts of an element such as first letter ,first line
inserting content before or after an element

::before inserts content before an element
::after inserts content after an element
::first-letter styles first letter of an element
::first-line tyles first letter of an element
::selection

Pseudo class
Gradient is change in color.
Transition change in property
animation change in style

Linear Gradient 
background: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1,color-stop2....);
\
Radical Gradient
background: radical-gradient(shape-size,color-stop1.....);
\
Conical Gradient
background: conical-gradient(shape-size,....);

Timing Funtions :
ease: starts slow speeds up then slows down
linear: constant speeds
ease-in: start slow then speed up
ease-out:start fast and slow down
ease-in-out:start slow speeds up then slows down


Animation:

animation name name of animation
animation duration: how long
animation-Timing-Funtion define pacing of animation
animation iteration count how many times ani repeat
animation direction : direction of animation
animation delay time before animation starts


Positioning Property
postition controlls the placment of element in the document
postition: static : Normal document flow no Positioning applied
postition: relative : positions element relative to its normal postition in doc flow
postition: absolute : removes element from normal document flow, Positioning it relative to nearest postition ancestor  used for popups, dropdowns and overlays
postition: fixed : postitions the relative to viewport browser window or fixed 
postition: sticky : behaves like  relative until specified scroll paint after which it behaves like fixed.
